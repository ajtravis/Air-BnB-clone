    https://my-air-bnb-clone.onrender.com

This website is a clone of air-bnb that I have created in order to showcase some of the skills that I have learned while at appAcademy .

The technologies used in creating the website are as follows:

    Backend: JavaScript, Express, Sequelize, SQLite(development), and Postgress(production)

    Frontend: React (with redux)

The first feature present is the user feature where visitors of the site have the ability to signup a user account for the site and login/logout of the account. There is also a demo login button for testing purposes.
So far this site has full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) features for spot listings as well as create, read, and delete features for reviews
(note: must be logged in as a user to post reviews or to use any spot features other than read).

Features to implement in the future:
