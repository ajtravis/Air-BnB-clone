This website is a clone of air-bnb that I have created in order to showcase some of the skills that I have learned.

The technologies used in creating the website are as follows:

    Backend: JavaScript, Express, Sequelize, SQLite(development), and Postgress(production)

    Frontend: React (with redux)
